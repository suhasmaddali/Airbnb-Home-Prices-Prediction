# üè°üè† Airbnb Home Prices Prediction 

With the aid of __machine learning__ and __data science__, it is possible to predict the prices of houses respectively. There are features such as __longitude__ and __latitude__ that help determine the prices along with neighborhood and the demand for the area.

Taking into consideration these features, machine learning predictions could be built. It is important to perform Exploratory Data Analysis to predict the demand for these houses as well. There could be null values that must also be addressed before giving those values to the models. Steps must be taken to ensure that models don't overfit the data or underfit it. 

Hosts who are using Airbnb application could benefit by using these algorithms in setting up the price so that it ensures that there is maximum profit generated by them. This would also lead to a growth and increase in revenue for Airbnb. 

## üëâ Directions to download the repository and run the notebook 

This is for the Washington Bike Demand Prediction repository. But the same steps could be followed for this repository. 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.

2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository. I would like to store it in "Git Folder" location.

3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location.

5. The link of the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be a html link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone html" where the html is replaced by the link to this repository. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(17).png" width = "600" />

6. After successfully downloading the repository, there should be a folder with the name of the repository as can be seen below.

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(19).png" width = "600" />

7. Once the repository is downloaded, go to the start button and search for "Anaconda Prompt" if you have anaconda installed. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(20).png" width = "600" />

8. Later, open the jupyter notebook by writing "jupyter notebook" in the Anaconda prompt. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(21).png" width = "600" />

9. Now the following would open with a list of directories. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(22).png" width = "600" />

10. Search for the location where you have downloaded the repository. Be sure to open that folder. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(12).png" width = "600" />

11. You might now run the .ipynb files present in the repository to open the notebook and the python code present in it. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(13).png" width = "600" />

That's it, you should be able to read the code now. Thanks.
