# üè°üè† Airbnb Home Prices Prediction 

With the aid of machine learning and data science, it is possible to predict the prices of houses respectively. There are features such as longitute and latitude that would help determine the prices along with features such as neighborhood and the demand for the area.

Taking into consideration these features, machine learning predictions could be built. It is important to perform Exploratory Data Analysis to predict the demand for these houses as well. There could be null values that must also be addressed before giving those values to the models. Steps must be taken to ensure that models don't overfit the data or underfit it. 

## Directions to run the Ipython notebook 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Once the Git is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to add the files or the repository. 
3. You'll have to click on "Gitbash here" that would be opened when you right click on a particular location. 
4. One the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then copy the clipboard file that is present when you click on Code in Github. The link must be pasted and run so that the files would be downloaded at the location of interest. 
5. Later, you'll need to use Anaconda Prompt and add "Jupyter notebook" in the prompt. 
6. This would open the jupyter notebook that could be used to run and load the .ipynb files respectively. Therefore, you would be able to run the project at hand.
