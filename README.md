## Introduction

With the aid of __machine learning__ and __data science__, it is possible to predict the prices of houses respectively. There are features such as __longitude__ and __latitude__ that help determine the prices along with other features such as neighborhood and the demand for the area.

## Metrics

The problem that we are trying to consider is the price prediction which is a __regression__ problem. Hence, we should choose the metrics that are important for the regression problem. Below are the metrics that were considered for this problem.

* [__Mean Squared Error (MSE)__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error.html)
* [__Mean Absolute Error (MAE)__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error.html)

## Machine Learning Analysis 

Taking into consideration these features, __machine learning predictions__ could be built. It is important to perform __Exploratory Data Analysis__ to predict the demand for these houses as well. There could be __null__ values that must also be addressed before giving those values to the models. Steps must be taken to ensure that models don't __overfit__ the data or __underfit__ it. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* It would be seen based on the results from the KDE plot that there are a few outliers in the prices of houses. Therefore, those prices had to be removed to reduce the mean squared error or mean absolute error of the models. __Removing outliers__ is a good idea as not all the models are robust to outliers. 
* A large portion of the users from Airbnb were willing to rent the entire apartment instead of a __private room__ or a __shared room__ respectively.
* A large number of houses taken into consideration were from __Manhattan__ followed by __Brooklyn__. 
* There were very few houses from __Staten Island__ compared to the other cities. 

## Machine Learning Models

There are many libraries from __sklearn__ which we might be using for our machine learning predictions. Below are the best performing __machine learning__ and __deep learning models__ that were used in the prediction of house prices.

* [__Decision Trees__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html)
* [__Random Forests__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html)
* [__Neural Networks__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPRegressor.html)

## Outcomes 

* Hosts who are using __Airbnb application__ could benefit by using these algorithms in setting up the price so that it ensures that there is maximum profit generated by them.
* This would also lead to a growth and increase in revenue for __Airbnb__. 

## Future Scope

* __Additional features__ such as __weather conditions__ and the __crime rate__ present in the localities also help determine the prices of houses which could be added to improve the __performance__ of machine learning models. 
* The output from the __best models__ should be integrated in __AirBnb application (app)__ so that hosts can determine the best price and this leads to their __higher engagement__ in the application. 
* The __best machine learning model__ could also be deployed in the cloud such as in __Amazon Web Services (AWS)__ so that we can host our product on websites so that it is accessible to users across different regions. 

## üëâ Directions to download the repository and run the notebook 

This is for the Washington Bike Demand Prediction repository. But the same steps could be followed for this repository. 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
 
&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(14).png" width = "600"/>
 
2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository. I would like to store it in "Git Folder" location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(15).png" width = "600" />

3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(16).png" width = "600" />


4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link of the repository.
 
&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(18).png" width = "600" />

5. The link of the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be a html link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone html" where the html is replaced by the link to this repository. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(17).png" width = "600" />

6. After successfully downloading the repository, there should be a folder with the name of the repository as can be seen below.

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(19).png" width = "600" />

7. Once the repository is downloaded, go to the start button and search for "Anaconda Prompt" if you have anaconda installed. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(20).png" width = "600" />

8. Later, open the jupyter notebook by writing "jupyter notebook" in the Anaconda prompt. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(21).png" width = "600" />

9. Now the following would open with a list of directories. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(22).png" width = "600" />

10. Search for the location where you have downloaded the repository. Be sure to open that folder. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(12).png" width = "600" />

11. You might now run the .ipynb files present in the repository to open the notebook and the python code present in it. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(13).png" width = "600" />

That's it, you should be able to read the code now. Thanks.
