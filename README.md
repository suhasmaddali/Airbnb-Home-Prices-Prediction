# üè°üè† Airbnb Home Prices Prediction 

With the aid of machine learning and data science, it is possible to predict the prices of houses respectively. There are features such as longitute and latitude that help determine the prices along with neighborhood and the demand for the area.

Taking into consideration these features, machine learning predictions could be built. It is important to perform Exploratory Data Analysis to predict the demand for these houses as well. There could be null values that must also be addressed before giving those values to the models. Steps must be taken to ensure that models don't overfit the data or underfit it. 

Hosts who are using Airbnb application could benefit by using these algorithms in setting up the price so that it ensures that there is maximum profit generated by them. This would also lead to a growth and increase in revenue for Airbnb. 

## Directions to run the Ipython notebook 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository.  
3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location. 
4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link of the repository. 
5. The link of the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be a html link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone html" where the html is replaced by the link to this repository. 
6. Once downloaded, you might use the jupyter notebook to run the .ipynb files or other navigators to open this file.
