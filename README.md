# üè°üè† Airbnb Home Prices Prediction 

With the aid of __machine learning__ and __data science__, it is possible to predict the prices of houses respectively. There are features such as __longitude__ and __latitude__ that help determine the prices along with other features such as neighborhood and the demand for the area.

## Metrics

The problem that we are trying to consider is the price prediction which is a regression problem. Hence, we should choose the metrics that are important for the regression problem. Below are the metrics that were considered for this problem.

* __Mean Squared Error (MSE)__
* __Mean Absolute Error (MAE)__

## Machine Learning Analysis 

Taking into consideration these features, __machine learning predictions__ could be built. It is important to perform __Exploratory Data Analysis__ to predict the demand for these houses as well. There could be __null__ values that must also be addressed before giving those values to the models. Steps must be taken to ensure that models don't __overfit__ the data or __underfit__ it. 

## Machine Learning Models

There are many libraries from __sklearn__ which we might be using for our machine learning predictions. Below are the best performing __machine learning__ and __deep learning models__ that were used in the prediction of house prices.

* __Decision Trees__
* __Random Forests__
* __Neural Networks__

## Outcome 

Hosts who are using __Airbnb application__ could benefit by using these algorithms in setting up the price so that it ensures that there is maximum profit generated by them. This would also lead to a growth and increase in revenue for Airbnb. 

## üëâ Directions to download the repository and run the notebook 

This is for the Washington Bike Demand Prediction repository. But the same steps could be followed for this repository. 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
 
&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(14).png" width = "600"/>
 
2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository. I would like to store it in "Git Folder" location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(15).png" width = "600" />

3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location.

5. The link of the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be a html link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone html" where the html is replaced by the link to this repository. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(17).png" width = "600" />

6. After successfully downloading the repository, there should be a folder with the name of the repository as can be seen below.

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(19).png" width = "600" />

7. Once the repository is downloaded, go to the start button and search for "Anaconda Prompt" if you have anaconda installed. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(20).png" width = "600" />

8. Later, open the jupyter notebook by writing "jupyter notebook" in the Anaconda prompt. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(21).png" width = "600" />

9. Now the following would open with a list of directories. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(22).png" width = "600" />

10. Search for the location where you have downloaded the repository. Be sure to open that folder. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(12).png" width = "600" />

11. You might now run the .ipynb files present in the repository to open the notebook and the python code present in it. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Airbnb-Home-Prices-Prediction/blob/main/images/Screenshot%20(13).png" width = "600" />

That's it, you should be able to read the code now. Thanks.
